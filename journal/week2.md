# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Homework Checklist
### Watch Week 2 Live-Stream Video
### Watch Chirag Week 2 - Spending Considerations (Coming Soon)
### Watched Ashish's Week 2 - Observability Security Considerations
### Instrument Honeycomb with OTEL
### Instrument AWS X-Ray
### Configure custom logger to send to CloudWatch Logs
### Integrate Rollbar and capture and error

## Homework Challenges
### Instrument Honeycomb for the frontend-application to observe network latency between frontend and backend[HARD]
### Add custom instrumentation to Honeycomb to add more attributes eg. UserId, Add a custom span
### Run custom queries in Honeycomb and save them later eg. Latency by UserID, Recent Traces

## Notes

- In order to get honeycomb to receive data from the backend, I had to hard code the API key in the docker-compose
- For some reason, even though it was set in my gitpod environment:
```shell
gitpod /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023 (main) $ env | grep HONEYCOMB
HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=WcriyNaMANM2VIOU9K2IrB
```
- It wasn't actually being picked up when docker-compose ran with this environment variable:
```docker
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
```

- In reading other people's comments in youtube, it looks like restarting the gitpod environment fixes that issue above for some reason

# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Lecture Notes
- AWS Aurora vs AWS RDS Postgrs, which is better?
    - Depends on use case, RDS Posgres is way cheaper and I assume less fully featured?

- Used the aws-cli to deploy an RDS Postgres instance
- Important to note that RDS Postgres can only be stopped temporarily for 7 days!!!
    - After that, it turns back on and starts to incur spend
